class_name IVFullScreenManager
extends Node


## Handles full screen / minimize toggles.
##
## This node is not added in [IVCoreInitializer] by default, and its function is
## completely duplicated by [IVFullScreenButton]. Add this node only if you want
## full screen toggle via hotkey but don't need the GUI button.
