## Default simulator root node.
##
## An instance of this class named 'Universe' is the main scene and simulator
## root node in [url=https://github.com/ivoyager]I, Voyager's Planetarium and
## Project Template[/url]. To change this, have a Node3D named 'Universe' in
## the scene tree or set member [code]universe[/code] or [code]universe_path[/code]
## in IVCoreInitializer ["addons/ivoyager_core/singletons/core_initializer.gd"].[br][br]
##
## We use origin shifting to prevent 'imprecision shakes' caused by vast scale
## differences, e.g, when viewing a small body at 1e9 km from the sun. To do
## so, [IVCamera] adjusts the translation of this node (or substitute root
## node) every frame.[br][br]
##
## If [code]pause_only_stops_time = true[/code] in IVCoreSettings
## (["addons/ivoyager_core/singletons/core_settings.gd"]), then [IVStateManager]
## will set [code]pause_mode = PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS[/code] in this node and in
## [IVTopGUI]. In this mode, [IVCamera] can still move, visuals work (some are
## responsve to camera) and user can interact with the world, and only
## [IVTimekeeper] pauses to stop time.

const PERSIST_MODE := IVEnums.PERSIST_PROPERTIES_ONLY ## Don't free on load.
const PERSIST_PROPERTIES: Array[StringName] = [&"persist"]


## This dictionary is not used by ivoyager_core but is available for game save
## persistence by external projects if ivoyager_save plugin is also
## present. It can hold Godot built-ins, nested containers or other 'persist 
## objects'. For details on save/load persistence, see
## [url]https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_save[/url].
